Project goals
=============

Agility
*******

Making modifications to the content of the site currently requires a build of static files and a level of technical expertise. The site content and appearance need to be easier to update.

Involvement
***********

As the Python community continues to grow, so does the amount of individuals that would like to contribute to the site. There should be a clear definition of how to contribute and where help is needed.

Localization
************

To promote diversity in the Python community a concerted effort should be made towards creating localized content.

Extensibility
*************

There should be an analysis of the types of data that could be made available to the community, allowing users to extend the Python site.

Accessibility
*************

Visitors that are new to Python or programming should be able to easily get started with Python. The site should have a clear path and guides for downloading, installing and quickly trying out the language.

Presentation
************

The site is in need of a makeover from both a visual and architectural standpoint. The emphasis should be on enhancing the Python brand and improving the user experience.
