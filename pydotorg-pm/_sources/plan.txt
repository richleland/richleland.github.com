Project plan
============

Research
********

* Create a map of the current Python sites
* Create a master list of current administrators and contributors
* Determine the various pieces of the online Python ecosystem
* Analyze current site and determine what works, what does not work
* Explore project goals and options for achieving them
* Create team of community members to elicit insight through questionnaires
* Gain understanding of systems and current technology implementation
* Survey of technologies available for enhancements
* Determine content priorities (e.g. downloading, case studies, community, etc.)

Propose
*******

Create a formal proposal for the PSF board with:

* Research summary
* Technology options
* Content migration plan
* Target timelines
* Project team(s)
* Phased approach
* Methods of measuring success
* Execution/vendor search plan

Implement
*********

Once input, revisions and approval are provided by the PSF the implementation should begin. At this time it may be prudent to call a meeting of the project team(s), whether remote or at a central gathering place, to discuss the battle plan and rally the troops.
